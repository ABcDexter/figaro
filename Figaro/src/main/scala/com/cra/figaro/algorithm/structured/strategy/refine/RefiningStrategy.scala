/**
 * A refining strategy takes an inference problem over a set of factors and improves it to better reflect the underlying
 * model. The exact notion of "improvement" should be specified in subclasses. The most common use cases include
 * expanding additional subproblems, or sampling additional values for elements with infinite ranges.
 *
 * Refining is separate from solving, but can be thought of as the process of deciding how much of a problem we want to
 * solve.
