 * Refining strategies that start with a list of components belonging to a single problem, working bottom-up to
 * expand the model lazily by recursing through subproblems.
 * @param problem Problem to refine.
 * @param initialComponents List of components belonging to the problem from which to begin bottom-up decomposition.
 * @param maxDepth Maximum depth of expansion from the initial components given. Depth is decremented each time the
 * algorithm recurses into a subproblem through an expandable component. When the depth reaches -1, the algorithm
 * returns * for the range of a component. Thus, setting the maximum depth to 0 corresponds to not recursing at all.
 * Defaults to `Int.MaxValue` for expansion of the entire model (does not terminate on infinite models).

   * As a rule, this method never works in the other direction. If component B depends (directly or indirectly) on

   * infinite loops, and to guarantee that the range of A does not unpredictably change in the middle of a call to
