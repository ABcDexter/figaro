/**
 * Refining strategies that operate by decomposing components. This involves processing problem components by generating
 * ranges for variables, expanding relevant subproblems, and creating factors. This strategy visits components at most
 * once, so generally it is of no use to call `execute` multiple times.
 *
 * Needed components are discovered lazily by working backwards from the initial components. As a result, the strategy
 * makes no guarantees about visiting components that are not needed.
 * @param collection Collection of components to refine.
 * @param rangeSizer Method to determine the size of the range of components.
 * @param parameterized Indicates whether or not to make parameterized factors.
 * @param done Problem components that were already processed, which should not be visited again. This is explicitly a
 * mutable set so that nested decomposition strategies can update any enclosing decomposition strategy with the
 * components that were processed.
