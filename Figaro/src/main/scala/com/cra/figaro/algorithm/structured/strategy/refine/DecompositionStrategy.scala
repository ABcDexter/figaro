/**
 * Refining strategies that operate by decomposing subproblems. This involves processing problem components by
 * generating ranges for variables, expanding relevant subproblems, and creating factors. The strategy visits each
 * relevant component exactly once. This does not solve the problem or any nested subproblems.
 * @param problem The problem to decompose
 * @param rangeSizer The method to determine the range of components
 * @param bounds Lower or Upper bounds
 * @param parameterized Indicates if this problem parameterized
 * @param done Problem components that were already processed, which should not be visited again. This is explicitly a
 * mutable set so that nested decomposition strategies can update any enclosing decomposition strategy with the
 * components that were processed. Defaults to the empty set.
