/**
 * Refining strategies that operate by decomposing components. This involves processing problem components by generating
 * ranges for variables and expanding relevant subproblems. This strategy visits components at most once, so generally
 * it is of no use to call `execute` multiple times.
 *
 * Needed components are discovered lazily by working backwards from the initial components. As a result, the strategy
 * makes no guarantees about visiting components that are not needed.
 *
 * Expanding subproblems proceeds in a depth-first manner. To avoid infinite recursions, the strategy sets a subproblem
 * as open before executing recursively on the subproblem. When refining of the subproblem is complete, the subproblem
 * is once again set as closed. For this to work correctly, this usually means that if a recursive
 * `DecompositionStrategy` is called from anything but the top-level, any subproblems that contain `initialComponents`
 * directly or indirectly must also be marked as open. Thus, it is usually safest to call `DecompositionStrategy` from a
 * set of top-level components.
 * @param collection Collection of components to refine.
 * @param done Problem components that were already processed, which should not be visited again. This is explicitly a
 * mutable set so that nested decomposition strategies can update any enclosing decomposition strategy with the
 * components that were processed.
