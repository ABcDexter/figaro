/**
 * Strategies that refine a fixed set of components without recursing or visiting other components. The primary purpose
 * of this strategy is as a ranging tool. New elements will not be added to the collection, unless they belong to newly
 * expanded subproblems, in which case they will be added without being refined. Another way of saying this is that this
 * strategy will not recursively refine subproblems.
 * @param collection Collection of components to refine.
 * @param updates Components to refine. Often, this is a set of atomic components their dependencies. Note that this
 * strategy does not recursively update any components not in this set. This, it is up to the caller of this constructor
 * to ensure that such a call maintains consistency across component ranges.

   * As a rule, this method never works in the other direction. If component B depends (directly or indirectly) on
   * component A, then calling decompose on A will never recursively call decompose on component B. This is to avoid
   * infinite loops, and to guarantee that the range of A does not unpredictably change in the middle of a call to
