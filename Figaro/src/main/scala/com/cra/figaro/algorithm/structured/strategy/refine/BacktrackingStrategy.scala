/**
 * Refining strategies that start with a list of components belonging to a single problem, working bottom-up to expand
 * the model lazily. "Backtracking" refers to the fact that this strategy propagates updates to ensure consistency. For
 * example, if refining the subproblem of an expandable component forces the creation of new subproblems, then the
 * strategy expands subproblems again until this process terminates.
 *
 * In terms of performance characteristics, it is known that there exist models with n components for which this
 * strategy requires Omega(n^2^) time. However, upper bounds on running time, as well as sufficient conditions for this
 * algorithm to take linear time, remain open. For an alternative lazy algorithm with better understood performance,
 * consider `RecursionDepthStrategy`.
 * @param problem Problem to refine.
 * @param initialComponents List of components belonging to the problem from which to begin bottom-up decomposition.
 * @param maxDepth Maximum depth of expansion from the initial components given. Depth is decremented each time the
 * algorithm recurses into a subproblem through an expandable component. When the depth reaches -1, the algorithm
 * returns * for the range of a component. Thus, setting the maximum depth to 0 corresponds to not recursing at all.
 * Defaults to `Int.MaxValue` for expansion of the entire model (does not terminate on infinite models).
