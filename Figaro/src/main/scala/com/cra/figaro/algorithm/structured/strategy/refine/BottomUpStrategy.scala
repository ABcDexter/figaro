/**
 * Refining strategies that start with a list of components belonging to a single problem, working bottom-up to
 * decompose the entire model. The primary purpose of this strategy is as a tool to expand the model in the component
 * collection by adding needed elements to the collection and recursing on subproblems.
 *
 * This will fail on infinitely recursive models.
 * @param problem Problem to refine.
 * @param initialComponents List of components belonging to the problem from which to begin bottom-up decomposition.
 * @param done Problem components that were already processed, which should not be visited again. This is explicitly a
 * mutable set so that nested decomposition strategies can update any enclosing decomposition strategy with the
 * components that were processed. Defaults to the empty set.
